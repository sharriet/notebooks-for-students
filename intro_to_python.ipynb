    "In Python, variables can be defined anywhere in the script, and the **type** of data they contain doesn't need to be declared explicitly - it is implied by the **syntax** of the language. In programming, when you give a value to a variable we call it an **assignment**. \n",

    "Lists are great for grouping related variables. Sometimes the data we want to store in a variable has a more complex structure then can be represented by a simple list. In such situations we might turn to an alternative data structure called a **dictionary**. A dictionary is essentially a container for a group of **key value pairs** (sometimes referred to as 'associative arrays'). Each key value pair represents an item in the dictionary.\n",
